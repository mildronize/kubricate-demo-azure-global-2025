# 🎤 Type-Safe Infrastructure: Reimagining Kubernetes with Kubricate — Live on AKS

**Global Azure 2025 Demo Repository**

This repository contains a step-by-step demo of how to build **type-safe, declarative, and reusable Kubernetes infrastructure** using [Kubricate](https://github.com/thaitype/kubricate), a TypeScript-based infrastructure framework.

> 🧱 Forget fragile YAML.
> 
> ✨ Compose infrastructure like software.
>
> ☁️ Deploy seamlessly to AKS and beyond.

## 📦 What You'll Learn

| Folder            | Focus                                          | Concepts Introduced                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `1-basic`         | Deploying with built-in stacks                 | `SimpleAppStack`, `NamespaceStack`                   |
| `2-custom-stacks` | Creating custom reusable stacks                | `createStack`, `ResourceComposer`                    |
| `3-secret`        | Managing secrets declaratively and securely    | `SecretManager`, `useSecrets`, connectors, providers |
| `demo/WebApi`     | A sample .NET app containerized for deployment | Docker, K8s deployment target                        |

## 🚀 Requirements

* Node.js (>= 20)
* Kubernetes cluster (e.g., AKS)
* `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
* Optional: `.env` file for secrets when using `3-secret`

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
To begin, navigate to one of the examples:

```bash
cd 1-basic
npm install
npx kubricate generate --stdout | kubectl apply -f -
```

## 🔐 Secure by Design

Kubricate introduces a powerful secret management layer, allowing you to:

* Declare what secrets you need (`addSecret`)
* Choose how to fetch them (`Connector`)
* Choose how to inject them (`Provider`)
* Keep secrets out of your codebase

All in a **type-safe, centralized contract**.
